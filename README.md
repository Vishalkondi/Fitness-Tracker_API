A simple React-based fitness tracker application that fetches real-time fitness data, including steps, calories burned, and heart rate. The data is fetched from an API and updated every 30 seconds.

## Features

- Displays real-time fitness data: steps, calories, and heart rate.
- Auto-fetches new data every 30 seconds.
- Manual refresh button to fetch the latest data on demand.
- Easy-to-use and responsive UI.
